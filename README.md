Here, the basic diagram denotes that the Hospital node is the super node. The next level consists of Doctors nodes, and each doctor node contains their surgeries, specialization areas, so that they can select the patients according to their choice. This provides the doctors flexibility to choose patients at their will and also, according to their forte.
The last level, consists of the patients, who are taken by the doctor nodes. The doctor nodes govern over the patient nodes.

One of the most striking and unique features for this database is that its hierarchical, it means that the patient nodes data can be edited only by the Administrator, and is secured by a login password. Also, the patientâ€™s discharge records and the reports, everything can be edited only and only by the doctors in a securely authenticated manner.
